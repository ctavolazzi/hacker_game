The goal of the game is to discover a series of hidden messages containing clues to unlock codes.

The user inputs various "unlock codes" (strings or numbers) into a text box, then clicks a button to submit their input.

Depending on what the user types, the message in the box below will update to reveal new information.

The user can only submit one unlock code at a time. The game has no memory of past unlock codes.

Each unlock code is run through a simple switch function to test which message should be revealed.

There is probably an easier way to do this but I don't know how to do it another way yet.

Will update as I learn more code.
